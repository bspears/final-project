#Final project

From the website's About section: 

If you’re going to be visiting a new city and need to know all the “must-see” spots, this website is for you. Picture us as the friendly locals at your destination, tipping you off to what venues, restaurants, and hot spots you simply cannot miss while you’re here. On top of that, once you’ve checked out all the cities have to offer, you’ll be an instant local yourself.

From the Instant Local homepage, navigate to one of our profiled cities and check out a few of our "must-see" locations. On each city page, you can filter results by type of location (Restaurants, Landmarks, Venues, and Outdoor locations), view more details and the address of each location, and add specific locations to a locally-stored favorites list.

This website was designed and built by [Ben Spears](https://github.com/bspears), [Keri Brady](https://github.com/KeriBrady), and [Jon Harwood](https://github.com/jhharwood88).
