            <p>The Crystal Ballroom, which is owned by McMenamins, is one of Portland’s oldest music venues, serving as a concert hall for over 90 years. The Crystal first opened its doors in 1914 as a premier Ballroom, and was a dance-revival hall during the Great Depression. During the 1960’s it was host to some of the biggest names in rock and roll, including an often-debated rumor that Little Richard fired Jimmi Hendrix during a gig here. Since McMenamins’ purchase in 1997, the dance floor has been returned to its original working order, and is the only “floating” dance floor left in the US. The dance floor is mechanically elevated from its base, allowing dancers the feeling of “dancing on clouds”.</p>
