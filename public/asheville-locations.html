            <p>The Orange Peel is one of Asheville’s premiere concert venues, as well as a rich part of Asheville’s history. The building’s roots begin in the 1950’s and became The Orange Peel in 2002, thanks in part to a downtown revitalization project. It underwent renovations in 2009 to expand its seating to 1,100 patrons as well as building another private club into the building, called PULP. The venue has been host to many big names such as Bob Dylan, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Lauren Hill, proving it is the best destination for music fans when in the Ashville area.</p>
